You aims of this project are three-fold:

1. *Encourage innovation-by-cooperation* across KIPP regions and single-site schools in analyzing, reporting, and visualizing data. We want to avoid reinventing the wheel. 
2. *Foster learning-by-doing* and skillfullness within KIPP's data science community. We want to grow in our roles. 
3. *Build robustness-by-iteration* by using a [distributed][distributed], [agile][agile], open-source development plan. We want to be efficent with our time and others.
