James Dozier (@jdozier) has done it again!  Not only did he kick off this entire project with his now renown [KIPP Share](http://www.kippshare.org) post [KIPP Network Normed Data Warehouse](https://www.kippshare.org/message/12867#12867), but he's added **the first real commit** to KIPP Silo. IT is called [Silo Conveyor](https://github.com/kippdata/***REMOVED***/tree/master/scripts/Silo%20Conveyor) (see what he did there) and is the start of Python script that grabs and adds the AssessmentsResults.csv from the MAP CDF to a database. 

**NB: this first script is not meant to be intimidating** for those less experienced in the dark arts of writing a script to read a data file, create a connection to a database, and load that data into the database.  Rather, it simply gives us a glimpse into the direction we would like to head. Clearly written code that not only serves the practical needs of getting our data into a warehouse, but the provide a longer term opportunity to help us each learn how to better do our jobs with these types of tools. 

True story: I knew no Python a little over a year ago, but I quickly figured out how to write a simple script that pulls MAP CDFs from NWEA's MARC site and loads them into a simple database.  Andrew Martin (@almartin82) did the same thing. In this case Python was both (i) the right tool for the job and (ii) a relatively straightfoward language to learn.  And it has really great facilities for connecting with databases.  

I promise to get something up about setting up a SQL Server Database on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) soon.  It will be a gentle, step-by-step guide for getting something up and running. 

And again, kudos to James for kicking this thing off right!
