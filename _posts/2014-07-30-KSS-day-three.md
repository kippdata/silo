It's Wednesday.  I'm in the Grit Lounge.  There's power though not many chairs. Come on end all.  I'll be working on:

* spinning up an EC2 instance on AWS with Windows Server and SQL server running;
* docummenting that proces;
* setting up a persistent VPN to Pearson Hosted PowerSchool;
* documenting that process too;
* Connecting our fist KIPP Silo instance to PowerSchool and (ambitiously) Illuminte, and
* Documenting those connections.

If all goes well, I hope to have the first 3 bullets done by lunch.

Here's the location of the Grit Lounge for those who don't yet know:
