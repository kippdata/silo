It's Thursday.  I'm in the Grit Lounge again with Andrew (I'll be in an out all AM, but Andrew will be around).  

In the afternoon (after 1:30) the foundation reserved a room for our use: 372 A

This is what I'll be working on today

* documenting the process to spin up an [EC2 instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) on AWS with Windows Server and SQL Server 
* documenting how to set up a persistent VPN to Pearson Hosted PowerSchool;
* documenting how to connect our fist KIPP Silo instance to PowerSchool and (ambitiously) Illuminte

Andrew can help folks with database and R stuff.

So join us!
