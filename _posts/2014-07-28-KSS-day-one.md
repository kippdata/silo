If you are in Houston this Monday morning or afternoon, Andrew (@almartin82), Erin Gunn (@eringunn), Arie Glazier (@arieglazier) (he's new and with [KIPP New Orleans](http://www.kippneworleans.org) so be sure say hi to him ), and I  (@chrishaid) are working in 342 D of the GRB Conference Center. Here's handy map:

Come visit us if you want to work on data warehousing, etc. Hopefully we can find a home base (I'm thinking the Grit or Optimism Lounges once they open).  

Also, please forward this information to any and all who want to work some data stuff!

Looking forward to seeing you all,

Chris and Andrew (and James in spirit).
