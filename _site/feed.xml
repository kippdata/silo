        <title>First Real Commit!!!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;James Dozier (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jdozier&quot; class=&quot;user-mention&quot;&gt;@jdozier&lt;/a&gt;) has done it again!  Not only did he kick off this entire project with his now renown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kippshare.org&quot;&gt;KIPP Share&lt;/a&gt; post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kippshare.org/message/12867#12867&quot;&gt;KIPP Network Normed Data Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, but he’s added &lt;strong&gt;the first real commit&lt;/strong&gt; to KIPP Silo. IT is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kippdata/***REMOVED***/tree/master/scripts/Silo%20Conveyor&quot;&gt;Silo Conveyor&lt;/a&gt; (see what he did there) and is the start of Python script that grabs and adds the AssessmentsResults.csv from the MAP CDF to a database. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB: this first script is not meant to be intimidating&lt;/strong&gt; for those less experienced in the dark arts of writing a script to read a data file, create a connection to a database, and load that data into the database.  Rather, it simply gives us a glimpse into the direction we would like to head. Clearly written code that not only serves the practical needs of getting our data into a warehouse, but the provide a longer term opportunity to help us each learn how to better do our jobs with these types of tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True story: I knew no Python a little over a year ago, but I quickly figured out how to write a simple script that pulls MAP CDFs from NWEA’s MARC site and loads them into a simple database.  Andrew Martin (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/almartin82&quot; class=&quot;user-mention&quot;&gt;@almartin82&lt;/a&gt;) did the same thing. In this case Python was both (i) the right tool for the job and (ii) a relatively straightfoward language to learn.  And it has really great facilities for connecting with databases.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise to get something up about setting up a SQL Server Database on &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; soon.  It will be a gentle, step-by-step guide for getting something up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again, kudos to James for kicking this thing off right!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing KIPP Silo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to announce that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kippshare.org/message/12867#12867&quot;&gt;KIPP Network Normed Data Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; (gated) sparked by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jdozier&quot; class=&quot;user-mention&quot;&gt;@jdozier&lt;/a&gt; is up and running and Andrew, James, and I have come up with what we think is a relatively clever name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/KIPP_Silo_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;KIPP Silo&quot; title=&quot;KIPP Silo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ***REMOVED*** is ‘a deep bin for storing material’ as is KIPP Silo. KIPP Silo is the KIPP Network’s Self-organized, Iterative, Late-binding (or Lightweight), and Open-source (for now) data warehouse solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now things are bare bones, save for the fact we have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kippdata/***REMOVED***&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; which can be cloned or (probably) more likely forked for indiviudal development and collaboration.  In other words, anybody (well anybody who know’s how to use GitHub right now) can start writing and sharing code &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For what it’s work, I think the best git workflow for this project is either a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-forking&quot;&gt;forking workflow&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-feature-branch&quot;&gt;feature branch workflow&lt;/a&gt;).  My best guess is the former, although requiring a little more overhead will keep the waters of the master branch clearer, so to speak.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This landing page/website will be used for announcing version releases and providing some tutorials on using the tools we’ll use to coordinate our development efforts at building this.  I’ve started a stub in &lt;a href=&quot;tools.md&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/a&gt; I cannot convey to all of you how excited I am about this endevour, but I do know that our future selves will thank us!.&lt;/p&gt;
